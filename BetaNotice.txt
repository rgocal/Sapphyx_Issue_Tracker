**A message to the community and it's beta testers and most recently noticed feedback received** .

Thanks to you, update 1.54.55 was successfully published on Google Play tonight. Previously, Sapphyx Launcher had a handful of problems and inconsistencies that prevented users from enjoying the launcher from its full potential i had visioned it to be. Their's plenty of things i have todo yet to the launcher but I'm proud to say i have a number of strong backers behind me on this project and do not want it to stop. Please continue to be active and strong on the forums and social networks.

**What's to come**
Sapphyx Launcher now has a handful of features that keep users occupied and happy. Right now, the goal is to pretty much to salvage everything that we can and make it better. Continue to work out the kinks we find and make pre existing features better, more fluent, different equations to each problem and enhance the current user interface. Beta updates will drop as frequently as possible based on my schedule.

I will continue to keep the community up to date on progress on Google Plus and I will continue to work on other projects on the side.

Cheers!
